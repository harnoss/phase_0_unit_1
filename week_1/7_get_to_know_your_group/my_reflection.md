Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

I honestly feel a little bit overwhelmed. The highlight this week was my pairing session: It's good to see that I'm not the only one embarking on a road that feels bumpy at first, but much better when taking it in company and collaboration with others. I still feel like a surfer with water wigs in front of a huge wave, but this week showed me that there is no magic surf board to rescue me - I just have to learn how to swim. (Sorry for being poetic here, it's just Saturday night and pretty late already...). I also realized that before I can learn how to swim, I need to (re-)learn how to learn. I am used to people telling me very clearly, what to learn, in what sequence, to get to specific results. These results were benchmarked with other people's results so you know where you stand. This coding learning experience until now, however, is very different. It requires me to think much more deeply about where I need to invest more time to learn, how and where to seek advice, and be motivated by obstacles and struggles as well as by teaching/collaborating with others rather than by getting e.g. a good grade.
