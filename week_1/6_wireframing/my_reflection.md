## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

*I really enjoy working on design and user experience. I would have loved to dive deeper into how to use the various wireframing tools and will do so as soon as I find some time. In the meanwhile, I am drawing the wireframes by hand.
*I realized that so far I had a wrong idea of what wireframes are. Previously, I considered wireframes to be a way to sketch up the design of a website. Now, I realized that it is rather about figuring out what the core elements of a website are and how they relate to one another (the internal hierarchy). It's not about coloring yet, though.
*Sketching wireframes of 3 of my favorite websites helped me understand how similar they are  - in essence - even though they do so different things. There are some core components, e.g. navigation, logo, footer, call to action, references that in some way or another are expected to be there by users. Good to keep this in mind.
*Thinking about the process of user-centric design (from sketching to coding) I see that there is not the one way to do it. I had some trouble getting my head around this, but found some "salvation" by looking at the 5-day design sprint methodology of google Ventures that I found in related blogs (http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672887/how-to-conduct-your-own-google-design-sprint)
