## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* To me html makes totally sense: It reminds me of creating a puzzle, starting with cutting different pieces (divs), defining where they are (positioning), what they look like (id's/classes), and what they contain (paragraphs, links, images)
* I like the clear structure of html (open something, then close it PLUS branching); what I don't like as much is that I feel that once you insert a lot of text the code becomes very difficult to read. It would be better, if one could insert text the same way one inserts CSS to the html structure
* I used codeacademy and the html exercises there to get my head around links and placing images
