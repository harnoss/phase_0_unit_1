## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

* (Unfortunately) I did not have any struggles with setting up git/Github, so no learning here
* I would describe git as some sort of personal assistant who is watching over your shoulder while create something, e.g. a text document. When you add something to the document or make changes your assistant will make a photo copy of your original version and then let you create an updated one. Thus, over time, your assistant will admin and manage a huge pile of copies of your document along the lifespan of your project. You can always call up your assistant to go back in time to track changes, start new etc. (<< this is "version control" and git is a "version control system")
* Github is like a public libary where your assistant goes to store your local "inventory"/repository of documents/copies. In this way, you can access it remotely without having your assistant next to you PLUS More importantly, you can share your work with other people who come to the libary and collaborate with with you on your joint project.
* Developers use version control for two main reasons: be able to experiment/do trial & error with your code AND be able to colloborate effectively with an inifinite number of people. Both makes absolute sense to me and I don't want to imagine what coding looked like in the pre-"version control world" - I guess it was like cooking a soup with a group of people (= usually doesn't work out well). Through version control, every individual can take the soup, trial & error on some more salt, pepper or whatever and then suggest a change to the soup to the whole group only when it actually turned out to taste better. At the same time, you can also go back in time and take away some salt that you feel was too much. If only cooking with friends was as easy as coding colloboratively today!
