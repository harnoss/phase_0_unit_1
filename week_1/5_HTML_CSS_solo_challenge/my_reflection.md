## 5. [HTML/CSS Solo Challenge](5_HTML_CSS_solo_challenge/readme.md) Reflection

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

*I found this challenge challenging as it was the first time that I have actually built a html/css site from scratch on my own. It makes a huge difference to apply stuff vs. following a tutorial/reading through slides
*I wasn't sure how floating and positioning would exactely work. What really helped me was using http://jsfiddle.net/ to trial & error different versions. I spent a lot of time on adjusting different settings to see visually what would change.
*I learned that this is my preferred way to learning: through experimenting and visualizing changes to code immediately.
*I very much enjoyed floating the different divs and thinking about the layout; it's like doing a puzzle and quiet fun
*I feel confident about the learning objectives, what I want to dive into deeper, however, is the topic of pseudo-class selectors PLUS being faster overall; it still takes me too much time and thinking to go through it, so practice practice practice
