## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

*Things that I learned: web != internet, websites != webpages
*Things to remember when setting up html site: Changes are visible not before they have been locally committed and then pushed to github
*Seeing the web page live it felt like riding a bicycle for the first time
*I didn't see the html site up right away so I walked through this tutorial for help http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/
