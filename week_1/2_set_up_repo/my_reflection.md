## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Go on the "plus" symbol in github and create, it's like creating a "new event" on facebook if you have ever done that (including specifying whether it's public or private etc.
* A normal restaurant let's customers order the dish, then cooks it, and then serves it. A restaurant becomes "open source" when they - on top of that - print out the recipe of the dish to give it to their customers so that they can take it home to cook it on their own. "Open source" means that you share openly how you do things so that other people can replicate it (ie how a software runs). PLUS open source means that people give back by improving the source code through their own work. So the restaurant would end up with an even better receipe. It's a two-way street
* Linux and firefox demonstrate that open source is not utopia. It doesn't make me nervous at all as every time you create something you can choose whether you go for open source or not. Licenses are hugely important here, as they provide a way to gradually adjust the degrees of freedom (vs. protection) between the two opposite ends of "open source" vs. "full-blown copy right".
* I struggled with understanding the differences between the various different licences, but this additional resource helped: https://github.com/blog/1530-choosing-an-open-source-license
* My sort of aha-moment was today at lunch, when I asked the waiter what's in the soup that I had and he came back with the recipe in his hands to give it to me :)
