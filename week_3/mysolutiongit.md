## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Tells git to record a change, but not yet permanently. Do git commit to record change permenantly in the repo, do gut reset to reset/not record changes.

#### branch
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Creates some sort of "lab setting", where you can create/change the code without having to worry about affecting the master branch. So you "branch" out from the master code to a side-branch, work on that branch, and if it makes sense you "branch" back and merge with the original tree.

#### checkout
<!-- Your defnition here -->
With checkout you can switch from one branch to another

#### clone
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Copies remote to your hard drive

#### commit
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Basically, confirms the changes that have been added and make them permanent.

#### fetch
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Fetches changes that have been made to the repo on github and that have not yet been reflected to your local rep.

#### log
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Creates a list of all commits that have been made to repo

#### merge
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Merges changes between two branches.

#### pull
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Pulls changes that have been made to repo on github to your local repo.

#### push
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Pushes final code to github.

#### reset
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Resets added changes.

#### rm
<!-- Your defnition here -->
Removes a file/folder.

#### status
Gives you the status of adds/commits etc. of your local repo

## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository
git add .-> git commit -m -> git push origin master

- Fetch changes
git remote -v -> git fetch --all

- Commit locally
git add. -> git commit -m

## Release 5: Reflection
Unfortunately, this exercise was not part of my DBC repo (apparently the repo had been updated, but I missed the information message) so I had to go over it fast to meet the deadline tonight. Now, at least I know how to avoid that next time (by pulling changes that have been made to github repo to my local repo). And I will spend some extra hours tomorrow (Monday) to solidify my git skills. I feel "ok" with it now, but wanna do much more practical exercises to get into a state where I don't have to think about the right git commands anymore (now I still need to look them up). But I'm not yet far enough to really provide feedback to my peers' solutions so I will need to catch up with that tomorrow. It's really fun and empowering to use the command line to command my mashine, I have never done this before (I'm kind of the old school Windows user) so this aspect makes me literally feel more "in command" of my pc :)
