# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://harnoss.github.io/index2.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* I loved reading the blogs and learning about design and user experience. It's impressive to see that in extreme cases very small changes to e.g. the checkout process can lead to huge improvements in user experience and eventually, shop revenues. I learned that user experience needs qualitative interviews and focus groups to be tested effectively, so quant alone will carry you only half-way.
* I very much enjoyed working on my site, but feel somewhat frustrated to see that even a simple site like this still takes 6 hours to do. I am aware of most of the CSS/html concepts and can recognize them, but not necessarily implement them as quickly and swiftly. So I will focus on hands on practice from now on to train my skills. In terms of process I started out with a rough wireframe and then implemented it directly in html.After html I did CSS, but went back and forth iteratively, when things didn't work out the way I wanted to. Next time, I think I will take more time planning out the main elements of the site and explore various implementation options before I get into doing it (psoido-coding the site), because I feel that I have lost some time due to various iterations
* Next, I would like to add bigger sized versions of the photos, a scroll bar that helps skimming through the portfolio as well as a finetuned version that responds well to different screensizes.
* I found it difficult to apply the material that I learned as I experience a big gap between knowing something and applying it. My notebook helped me a lot as I could go back and forth to check my notes on specific topics. If not, stackoverflow was my helper :)
