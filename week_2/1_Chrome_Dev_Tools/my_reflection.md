# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
The DOM stores the page content so that it can be accessed by other languages e.g. JS or put differently, DOM takes html/CSS and translates that into objects/a structure so that other languages can interact with it. It makes sense to me to build on the hierarchy that is already there in a html/CSS file and translate that into a tree-like structure. Tags become objects - that makes sense to me.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
First of all, Wordpress works with JavaScript and my website is currently completely static; also, it is much more complex. So wordpress is maybe like a tree and compared to that is my website like a bonsai. The basic tree-like structure, however, is the same (as with bonsais...).

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
Super fun! Quiet accessible too, after having watched the great tuturial. I find this super helpful to modify a website real-time, see what's changing, learn from other websites, and do de-bugging or speed-enhancements. Will definately play around with this every day now.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
The tutorial was full of aha moments...the network tab in the dev tool section that shows when it what file loaded in a way solidified my understanding of how and what pieces come together to depict a website.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
No, the resources that were there were more than enough!
