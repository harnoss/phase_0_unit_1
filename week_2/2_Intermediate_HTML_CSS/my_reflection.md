# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* I can't see how you could code effectively in html without web standards. Developers need to align on some basic structures/ways to use and employ a language so that web pages can be easily shared, understood by everyone, and created collaboratively without friction.
* In this contect, I very much like the new HTML5 elements, because they drastically improve readability of code and make it much easier to understand quickly. It's also faster as instead of creating the same divs all over again and again you can now use one of the semantic markups.
* Reset is necessary to remove all the default CSS from the html markups, e.g. lists come with default bullet points or links are marked blue and are underlined
* I usually only use chrome, but I have built a website 5 years ago (soyez-special.com) that doesn't work on safari, so yes I have noticed that sites look different in different browsers and i think this is <strong> BAD </strong> adjusting to all the different browser specs makes it harder to develop a site.
* In terms of additional resources I am working with a book (html & css by Jon Ducket) that is super helpful, I used it to better understand "hover" as well as "liquid" vs "fixed width" layouts
