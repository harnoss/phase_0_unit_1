# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
Manage my studies and my work while at the same time getting all required prep work done. Specifically, I will be working on a project in China for 3 weeks and it's going to be a huge challenge to keep up with everything at the same time.

* How will you combat that?
I plan to (and already) do 2 hours of coding every morning before I get to start to do anything else (instead of doing it at the end of the day). I will need to get up earlier for this , but this way I wanna make sure to really learn every day.

* What techniques will you try?
I will try the pomodoro technique to become more aware of how well I spend my time and on which topics. I am already doing 2 minutes of meditating every day and it helps me to practice my attention and focus.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
In terms of timing: 2 hours a day + 1 full day on the weekends. Plus 1 full week full time before the start in June.
In terms of coding skills: Focus on the inevitable basics that I will need to get started in June (e.g. command line skills)
